# UnrealPak-Scripts
These are scripts that you can use to use Unreal Engine's official `.pak` system

## How to Use
1. Drop these into `[path to engine]/[Engine Version]/Engine/Binaries/Win64`
   - Example path is `C:/Unreal-Engine/UE_4.20/Engine/Binaries/Win64`. Default location is `C:/Program-Files/Epic Games/[Engine Version]`.
     <br>
     
     Note: Unreal will always install in a folder like this `UE_[Engine Version]` so Unreal Engine 5.2 would be `UE_5.2`.
3. Drag your desired folder over the desired file and done the proccess will be handled by the scripts

## Credits
I did not fully make these all I did was edit them to work with Unreal's official binaries. The original scripts came from some unrealpak thing I found while modding Five Nights At Freddy's Secuirity Breach.
